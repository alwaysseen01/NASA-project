# NASA-project
This informational page was a part of my exam task in IT STEP Academy ("Working with API with JavaScript" part).
It consists of functions such as:
- Get info about any asteroid from NASA asteroids database.
- Get space-image of the day.
- Get satellite photo by given attitude and longitude.

Quick guide to launch it:
  1. Download all files
  2. Secondly, unzip "mainPage-icons" folder to the same folder as project
  3. Open mainPage.html
